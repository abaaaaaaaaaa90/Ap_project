# Dressmaker
Continuation of the previous 2 phases of the advanced programming project of Bu Ali Sina University, which is modular with inheritance and polymorphism, in which we had to add a shopping class, as well as exception and vectors.
# Description
I had implemented the expectations that were asked of us in the third phase of the project in the previous two phases.
And in this phase, I just added a purchase class to my files and prevented some possible bugs.ition
